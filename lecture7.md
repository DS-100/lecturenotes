Starting point: understand what kind of data you have (numerical, ordinal,
categorical)

## Four examples of what not to do

### 2015 Congressional Hearing: Planned Parenthood

The chair of the congressional committee presented a plot:

    <plot of abortion and cancer screenings vs. time>

Plot shows 2006 - 2013

How many data points? What's suspicious about the plot?

### Voter Registration Trends in California

State publishes registration summaries and historical counts in previous years.

    <plot of majority party by County in California>

### Earnings

Federal gov. does a lot of surveys/studies. Bureau of Labor Statistics released
data on labor statistics.

    <plot of median weekly earnings, split by gender and edu level>

### Cherry Blossom Run

10 mile in DC during April, results available on Web. In 2012 nearly 17,000
runners ran.

    <scatterplot of time to finish vs. age>
